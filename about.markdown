## About this blog

  Welcome to my personal blog created to share my experiences and learning in .NET Core, software design, CS, etc. The main goal I pursue with this blog is to structure information in my head but I'd be happy if it helps someone else!

## About me

My name is Alexey Zharov. I'm a full-stack developer at [CQG](https://www.cqg.com/), Zelenograd, Russia. I have experience primarily with C#, ASP .NET Core and relational databases. These days I'm interested in data intensive applications design.
